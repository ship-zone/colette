# Setup

This describes setup from sources, mostly for developers and advanced users

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jolibrain/colette.git
```

2. Install dependencies and CLI

```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Run the server
```bash
./server/run.sh
```
If this succeeds, the swagger API is then available from `http://localhost:1873/docs`

Create the service via the REST API:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:1873/v1/app/app_colette -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @apps/app_colette/create_app.json
```

Launch the indexing process:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:1873/v1/index/app_colette -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @apps/app_colette/index_app.json
```

Get the status of the indexing process:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:1873/v1/index/app_colette/status
```

Once the indexing process is complete, you can ask questions with REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST  http://localhost:1873/v1/predict/app_colette -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @apps/app_colette/query_app.json
```
